# Shakerr.io

Shakerr.io is a web application that serves recipes for beverages and allows registered users to create, read, update, and delete their own custom beverage recipes.

## Tech

Shakerr.io was built using React and Bootstrap for the frontend with MongoDB and Express for the backend. Stock recipes were sourced via the API from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

The initial [wireframe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPPMtBHEJ5juKwZ6rWt3JP77LGlvljh0/view?usp=sharing) was built using Balsamiq.
